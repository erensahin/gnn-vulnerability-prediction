# Vulnerable Code Change Prediction

## Installation

Python 3.6+ is required. Additionally, LLVM backend is required for AST parsing

First, install requirements.

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then, add project to PYTHONPATH, according to your OS.

## Usage

### Config Setup

Rename `vulnerability_prediction/config/config.yaml.example` as `vulnerability_prediction/config/config.yaml` and fill acorrdingly.

### Scrapers

Currently, wireshark and mozilla foundation bug repository scrapers are implemented. Just execute their scripts.

    ```
    python vulnerability_prediction/scrapers/wireshark_scraper.py
    python vulnerability_prediction/scrapers/mozilla_scraper.py
    ```

### Commit Mining

Commit mining in done in a sequential way. First, file changes are extracted. Then, commits are matched to bugs. Finally, vulnerability inducing code changes are found by SZZ algorithm.

Execute following scripts:

    ```
    python vulnerability_prediction/commit_mining/extract_file_changes.py
    python vulnerability_prediction/commit_mining/bug_commit_matching.py
    python vulnerability_prediction/commit_mining/szz.py
    ```
    
### AST Extraction

Make sure that you have LLVM backend an Clang installed. Then, execute

    ```
    python vulnerability_prediction/ast_extraction/ast_extractor.py
    ```
